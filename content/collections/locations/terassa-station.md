# Terrassa - Train Station

If youâ€™re coming from central Barcelona then you can take a train (R4) from Barcelona Sants to Terrasa station and catch one of our mini shuttles to the campus.

Please go to the station exit where our driver Jake (wearing an IPFS T-shirt) will be waiting for you. Shuttles will run on a loop every half hour between Terrassa train station and Campus La Mola from 3:30pm to 6:00pm (last pickup 5:40pm)
