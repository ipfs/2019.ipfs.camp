## ⚡️ Lightning Talks

Lightning Talks are one of the most entertaining and inspiring sections of IPFS Events. These serve to enable everyone attending the conference to share an update on their own projects with the whole community. Lightning Talks are designed for high throughput, high velocity, and large coverage.
