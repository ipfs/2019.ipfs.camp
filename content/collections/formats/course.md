## 👩🏽‍🏫 Core & Elective Courses

The Core and Elective Courses are the main sessions for the InterPlanetary Space Training Program (aka IPFS Camp). These are designed to train new IPNauts and more seasoned IPBuilders in the arts of the DWeb and P2P.

The Courses are intensive workshops of 75 minutes each. The Core Courses will be a series of sessions to level-up each participant's understanding so that we all share a great baseline to build upon. The Elective Courses will cover even more bleeding-edge topics of the DWeb, where each participant decides which ones to attend to advance their knowledge and deepen their understanding.

For this edition of IPFS Camp, the Courses list is:

### Core Course A - Understanding how the InterPlanetary File System deals with Files

> Everyone will leave this session with a full understanding that Files are transformed into DAGs and that there are multiple DAG layouts and how IPFS uses DAGs for Sync'ing
