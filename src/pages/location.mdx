# Campus La Mola, Barcelona

<div className="measure-wide">

IPFS Camp will take place at Campus La Mola. Set in the heart of the beautiful Sant Llorenç del Munt nature reserve on the outskirts of Barcelona. It’s the perfect place to explore new ideas and has everything we’ll need on site for our interplanetary adventure.

## Transportation

<div className="measure-wide">

IPFS Camp shuttles will leave from Terminal 1 (international terminal) at BCN at 4:00pm. There will be guides at arrivals (look out for the IPFS Camp signs!) who will lead you to the bus.

If you’re coming from central Barcelona then you can take a train (R4) from Barcelona Sants to Terrasa station and catch one of our mini shuttles to the campus.

Shuttles will run every half hour from 3pm - 6pm. Maybe put a little shuttle schedule?
