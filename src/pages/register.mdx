## Financial assistance

We have a limited number of diversity scholarships to provide support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalised groups in technology and a limited number of need-based scholarships for those who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend IPFS camp for financial reasons.

You can indicate if you would like to be considered for a scholarship on our application form.
