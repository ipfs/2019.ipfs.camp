Prepare for an intergalactic adventure! We’re excited to welcome you to the inaugural IPFS Camp, a three day hacker retreat for the creators and builders of the distributed web. Join us on 27-30th June at the beautiful Campus La Mola in Barcelona for an action-packed program of workshops, talks and deep dives on everything IPFS.

The space for IPFS camp is limited so we’re asking everyone to apply and let us know why they want to join the adventure. Maybe you’ve built something amazing on top of IPFS, maybe you’re just getting started but have some awesome ideas or

Your camp ticket includes accommodation for three nights, airport transfers, all food and drinks, group activities and hacking sessions. Everything is taken care of so we can focus on building the future of the internet.
