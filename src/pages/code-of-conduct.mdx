# Code of Conduct

IPFS events are community events intended for collaboration in the tech community.

We value the participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all IPFS events.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any IPFS event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct and the [IPFS Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Organizers will enforce these codes throughout the event.

Code of Conduct

IPFS Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Camp participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the camp without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the IPFS Camp Team immediately. Organizers can be identified by t-shirts marked IPFS Camp TEAM. There will be someone available at reception 24/7 throughout the camp and you can also contact our camp director directly [camp@ipfs.io](mailto:camp@ipfs.io) if you need assistance.

Our team will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your participation and attendance.
