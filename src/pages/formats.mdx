## 👩🏽‍🏫 Core & Elective Courses

The Courses of the InterPlanetary Space Training Program (aka IPFS Camp) are one of the main sessions for the event. These are designed to train new IPNauts and the more seasoned IPBuilders in all the arts of the DWeb and P2P.

The Courses are intensive workshops of 75 minutes each. The Core Courses will be a series of sessions to level-up each participant's understanding so that we all share a great baseline to build upon. The Elective Courses will cover even more bleeding-edge topics of the DWeb, where each participant decides which ones to attend to advance their knowledge and deepen their understanding.

## 📃 Poster Sessions

Poster Sessions are one of the all times favorite IPFS Events. These sessions are designed to propagate knowledge by having small teams of people explore one of the many pieces of the IPFS stack together, with the goal to understand it so well that they can present it to the whole group aided by a Poster.

This session is inspired by the famous [Feynman Technique](https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/), developed by Richard Feynman himself. The technique is simple and powerful, it suggests that for one to understand something well, it needs to be able to explain it.

## ⚡️ Lighting Talks

Lighting Talks are one of the most entertaining and inspiring sections of the IPFS Events. These serve the purpose to enable everyone that is attending the conference to share their own update on their projects with the whole community. Lighting Talks are designed for high throughput, high velocity and large coverage.

# 🐋 Deep Dives

The Deep Dives format is designed to give all participants a taste of what it feels like to work on the big and meaty Open Problems by contributing directly to them in an intense design session - evaluating all the possible solutions, their advantages and shortcomings, and documenting the results.

This type of discussions are core to the genesis of IPFS. We’ve done multiple over the years which yield to many valuable results such as IPLD, PubSub, GraphSync and other advancements to the original IPFS protocol.

These design sessions are not about explaining how things work, they were focused on finding the solution with the knowledge and resources we had available.

## 🧩 Unconf

We will host an Unconf segment during IPFS Camp to create space for all the conversations, talks, discussions and idea sharing that didn’t get the opportunity to be discussed during the other sessions.

## 🧬 Sci-Fi Fair

Do you fancy Science Fairs? Always felt that there was something missing? Something even more futuristic? Despair no more and welcome to the 🧬 IPFS Camp Sci-Fi Fair 🛸. The Sci-Fi fair was created to give a free roaming space for all our attendees to meet all sorts of projects happening from the other attendees of the event.
